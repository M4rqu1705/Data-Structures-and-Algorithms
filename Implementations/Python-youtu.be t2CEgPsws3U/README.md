## [Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/t2CEgPsws3U)

This was one of my first attempts to learn Data Structures. I fell in love with [stacks](01\)stacks.py), learned about [queues](03\)queues.py), [sets](02\)sets.py), [binary search trees](04\)binary_search_trees.py), and [linked lists](05\)linked_lists.py), and was even able to implement my own data structure in an interview [LRUcache.py](LRUcache.py)

Fell short on time as I prepared for the interview. However, I learned a lot and wanted to keep these scripts nearby
