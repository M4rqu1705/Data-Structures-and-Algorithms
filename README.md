### ICOM 4025
Dr. Manuel Rodríguez Martínez has his ICOM 4035 course and laboratories recorded and published in [this](https://sites.google.com/a/upr.edu/icom-4035-spring-2015/home) Google Site. Since we are UPRM students aiming to develop our technical skills, I assumed it is ok to use these resources.

In order to organize and stream his videos a lot better I made a small website that facilitates surfing through his lectures
[right here](ICOM4025/Videos_Presentations_Custom.html). Just open the file in your browser and ta-da! Access to all his spring 2015 lectures and his presentations.

##### Textbook: [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](Data\ Structures\ and\ Algorithms\ in\ Java.pdf)

### Notes
I am taking down notes from the ICOM 4025 course in [this](Apuntes\ Data\ Structures.docx) MS Word Document.
